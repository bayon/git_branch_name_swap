This is the index.html file on the master branch. Before any other branches have been created.
-Now I'm making a change on this file from the 'alternative' branch.

now adding these before executing something similar.   
git branch -m master newfeaturebranch
git branch -m feature1 master

And...yes you can swap branch names. This line was added once the swap was complete.
on my local machine this appears as master in both git bash and vs code.
